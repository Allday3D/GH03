## ENC28J60 on a Nano (ATmega328P) as webserver
Control it with a browser on your computer, tablet or mobil or maybe with the timer example on Node-RED.
Or use the four manual-override buttons to control the four relays.
Nothing fancy with the simple code and Node-RED example that needs to cleaned up, made beter or even shorter.
But for now, it works.

## The Hardware

The project is based on the ENC28J60, placed on a Nano (ATmega328P).
4 way relayboard.
MP1584EN module.
Four switches (4 buttons and 10K resistors).
12 volt powersupply.

### Used Libraries

This project uses libraries and code by different authors:

https://github.com/njh/EtherCard EtherCard is a driver for the Microchip ENC28J60 chip

https://github.com/lexus2k/ssd1306 SSD1306 driver is Arduino style C/C++ library

https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time the Arduino Time Library
